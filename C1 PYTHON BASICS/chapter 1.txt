CHAPTER ONE 

PYTHON BASICS



1. values:  'hello', -88.8, 5
   operators:   +, -, /, *, 


2. variable: spam
   string: 'spam'


3. integer, float and string are some data types.


4. An expression is made up of values and operators.
   Expressions evaluate down to a single value.


5. Statement is for creating a variable and displaying values. 
   An expression evaluates and some value is obtained as result.


6. The variable bacon will contain the value 20 itself as value of bacon is not reassigned.


7. 'spam' + 'spamspam' evaluates to: 'spamspamspam'
   'spam' * 3 evaluates to: 'spamspamspam'


8. Variable names can't begin with a number hence 100 is an invalid variable name.
   But it can begin with _ or letters hence eggs is a valid variable name.


9. The int(), float() and str() functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number and string version of a value respectively.


10. 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
    The above expression causes an error because only strings can be concated to strings. In the expression, 99 is of integer data type.
    Integers can't be concated to string and hence TypeError is displayed.

    The error can be fixed by converting the integer value to a string value in the expression. 
    The corrected code:
    'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
