CHAPTER 9

READING AND WRITING FILES



1. A relative path is relative to the programâ€™s current working directory.


2. An absolute path always begins with the root folder.


3. Path('C:/Users') / 'Al' evaluates to C:\Users\Al.


4.  'C:/Users' / 'Al' results in an error, as / operator cannot be used to join two strings.


5. os.cwd is used to get the current working directory and os.chdir() is used to change it.


6. . gives the current working directory whereas .. gives the parent folder.


7. In C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt, 
   dir name: spam.txt
   base name: C:\bacon\eggs


8. The three mode arguments that can be passed to the open() function are read, write and append.
   read: open('file_path', 'r')
   write: open('file_path', 'w')
   append: open('file_path', 'a')

9.  If an existing file is opened in write mode, it's contents are deleted and the file is treated as a new empty file.


10. read() : read the entire contents of a file as a string value.
    readlines() : to get a list of string values from the file, one string for each line of text. 


11.  A shelf value resembles a dictionary.
