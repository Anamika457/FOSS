CHAPTER THREE 

FUNCTIONS



1. Functions are advantageous in the sense that repetition of code can be avoided resulting in a shorter and efficient program.


2.  Code in a function executed when the function is called and not when defined.


3. the def function_name() statement creates the function where 'function_name' is replaced by the name of the function.


4. Function is the code that performs a particular task whereas a function call is what prompts the code inside the defined function to be executed.


5. There is one global scope.
   There can be multiple local scopes, creating a variable whenever a function is called.


6. Local variables are destroyed once the function call returns.


7. Retuen value is the value the function evaluates to. Yes, it can be part of an expression.


8. If a function does not have a return statement, the return value is None.


9. By using the global keyword inside the function, the variable can be made to refer to the global variable.


10. None is a data type in itself.


11. import areallyourpetsnamederic statement imports the module named areallyourpetsnamederic.


12. The function bacon can be called by using spam.bacon() statement.


13. A program can be prevented from crashing by using try and except statements. 


14. The code that could have an error comes under the try clause. 
    When code in the try clause has an error, the program execution moves to the code in the except clause.
