CHAPTER 8

INPUT VALIDATION



1. No, PyInputPlus does not come with the Python Standard Library. It needs to be installed separately using pip install.


2. PyInputPlus is commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pyip because it is easier to type pyip instead of pyinputplus when a pyinputplus function is to be called.


3. inputInt() takes only integer inputs.
   inputFloat() takes only floating point numeric inputs.


4. num = pyip.inputInt('Enter a number: ', min=0, max=99)


5. allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword takes list of regular expression strings to determine what the pyinputplus function will accept or reject as valid input.


6. The function will raise RetryLimitException. 


7. 'hello' is printed since that is given as the default value.
